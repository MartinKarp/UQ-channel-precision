# UQ Turbulent Channel Flow at $Re_\tau = 180$

This repository contains the case used for the article "Uncertainty Quantification of Reduced-Precision Time-Series in Turbulent Channel Flow" and a draft of our post-processing scripts.

There has been several developments from our side on lower floating point precision in turbulence since this initial work (use of a simulator, higher Reynolds number, other discretizations,...) so feel free to contact me, makarp@kth.se, if you want more recent code and are interested in the work.

Neko has undergone some development from when this work was carried out and a version compatible with this case should be around version 0.6.0 https://github.com/ExtremeFLOW/neko/releases/tag/v0.6.0
